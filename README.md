#GitsTest


#Code Review by DC Alilonu. Overall solid code. The first GitsTest repo was very empty, but he updated it and added
# a lot more code. Will address more in my Journal(if I can). Overall it was soild. I don't know if this code
# is compileable or even runnable because of my lack of using shell as opposed to something like Java
# Overall the code was really good, but I think missing some things my repo had. Also he had like a million
# READMEs for some reason.
