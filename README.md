Block Code is about a free source that can use any 
of the code need for IDE. Block Code would going to
talk about why is code is going to use for any of the 
point needed for the porject. Block is use for the 
structed needed for the coding any else and making sure it is 
more organized.

The postive for my peer is he talk about the project for 
readme and talk about how he feel about the project. 
He know to do while loop if else block to making 
sense for bash and he should know about the python. He did know how to do 
if else good and he use "then"  for if else.

One improvement is about making more examples for his code
and examples which is going to make him better for Git.
